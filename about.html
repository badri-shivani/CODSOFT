        A job portal is a website where people who need jobs can find jobs and companies<br> 
        looking for job seekers can find the perfect employees. It serves as a medium where<br>
         job seekers can create profiles, upload resumes, and search for job openings across various industries<br>

          and locations. Employers, on the other hand, can post job vacancies, review applicant profiles, and conduct<br>
           the initial stages of the hiring process through the portal.

    Internship job portals are websites where students and recent graduates can find short-term work experiences to learn<br>
    and practice what they’ve studied. These experiences are called internships. These websites connect students with<br>
    companies that offer these learning opportunities. It’s like a special place to find temporary jobs that help you learn and<br>
    prepare for your future career.<br>
