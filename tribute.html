        <pre> Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 – 1 February 2003)[2] was an Indian-born <br>American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of <br>Indian origin to fly to space.</p>

    <h2 class="her">ABOUT THE LEGEND</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <p >
        ☛   <b>Kalpana Chawla</b>, PhD, was an engineer, pilot, and astronaut who spent more than 30 days<br>
         in space over two Space Shuttle missions.
    </p>


    <p >
        ☛  Chawla was born in Karnal, India, and was fascinated by flight since her childhood. She earned a bachelor’s<br>
        degree in <b>aeronautical engineering </b>from Panjab Engineering College, a master’s degree in aerospace<br>
        engineering from the University of Texas-Arlington, and a PhD in aerospace engineering from the University<br>
        of Colorado-Boulder. Chawla held numerous pilot licenses, including for airplanes, gliders, and seaplanes.<br>

    </p>


    <p >
        ☛  After completing her PhD in 1988, Chawla joined NASA’s Ames Research Center, where she specialized in the<br>
        fluid dynamics of aircraft. She later continued aerodynamics research in the private sector. In 1991 Chawla<br>
        became a United States citizen. NASA selected Chawla as an astronaut in late 1994 and she began astronaut<br>
        training in 1995.<br>

    </p>


    <p>
        ☛  In addition to preparing for spaceflight, astronauts are also tasked with ground-based technical projects.<br>
        Chawla worked on the development of the <b>Robotic Situational Awareness Display</b>, a tool to help astronauts<br>
        operate robotic arms. She also tested space shuttle control software.<br>
    </p>


    <p>
        ☛  Chawla flew on two Space Shuttle missions as a mission specialist. On November 19, 1997, she launched on<br>
        board Space Shuttle Columbia as part of STS-87. Chawla specialized in operating the robotic arm, which she<br>
        used to deploy the Spartan Satellite. During the 16-day mission, the crew conducted numerous experiments,<br>
        with a focus on materials science. Chawla made history as the first Indian woman, and the first South Asian<br>
        American woman, to fly in space. Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumal Gujral called Chawla in space to<br>
        congratulate her on her journey and express pride in her representing India in space.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        ☛ On <b>January 16, 2003</b>, Chawla launched on board Space Shuttle Columbia once more as part of STS-107.<br>
        During this 16-day mission, the crew performed over <b>80 scientific experiments</b>, with Chawla overseeing and<br>
        conducting microgravity experiments on crystal growth, combustion and fire suppression, as well as prostate<br>
        cancer. Chawla and the other six crewmembers–commander Rick D. Husband, pilot William C. McCool,<br>
        mission specialists David M. Brown, Michael P. Anderson, and Laurel B. Clark, and payload specialist Ilan<br>
        Ramon–were tragically killed when Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry on February 1, 2003.<br>
    </p>


    <p>
        ☛   During the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from<br>
        the Space Shuttle's external tank and struck the port wing of the orbiter. Previous shuttle launches<br>
        had seen minor damage from foam shedding,[22] but some engineers suspected that the damage<br>
        to Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew<br>
        could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed.<br>
